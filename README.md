netProspekt
===============

2D open source ORPG engine developed by Eatenbrain Games. Official site is [Indie Armory](http://indiearmory.com).

Do not look at name, this will not be port of Prospekt Source. I will try to port all features, but not internal handling, saving and rendering. I will try to use better coding practices as that old long-standing Mirage-like things what are slow and unreliable.
