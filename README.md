netProspekt
===============

2D open source ORPG engine developed by Eatenbrain Games. Official site is [Indie Armory](http://indiearmory.com).

Do not look at name, this will not be port of Prospekt Source. We will try to port all features, but not internal handling, saving and rendering. We will try to use better coding practices as that old long-standing Mirage-like things what are slow and unreliable.
